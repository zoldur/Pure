```
* Alias: **MN1**
* Address: **VPS_IP:PORT**
* Privkey: **Masternode Private Key**
* TxHash: **First value from Step 6**
* TxIndex:  **Second value from Step 6**
9. Save and close the file.
10. Open **Debug Console** and type:
```
masternode start-alias MN1
```
11. Login to your VPS and check your masternode status by running the following command.
